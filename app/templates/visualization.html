Node size represents the number of native and non-native speakers of a language. Edge size represents the number of translations, and edge opacity represents the statistical significance of this number.</p>

            <p ng-if="isActive('twitter')">Each node represents a language. Two languages are connected when users that tweet in one language are also significantly more likely to tweet in another language. Node size represents the number of native and non-native speakers of a language. Edge size represents the number of users tweeting in both languages, and edge opacity represents the statistical significance of this number.</p>

            <p ng-if="isActive('wikipedia')">Each node represents a language. Two languages are connected when users that edit an article in one Wikipedia language edition are significantly more likely to also edit an article in another language edition. Node size represents the number of native and non-native speakers of a language, the GDP per capita of speakers of that language, or the eigenvector centrality of that language. Edge size represents the number of editors editing an article in both languages editions, and edge opacity represents the statistical significance of this number.</p>

            <p>The position of a language in the Global Language Network is highly correlated with the number of globally famous people born in the territories associated with that language. We identify globally famous people using The MIT Media Labâ€™s <a href="http://pantheon.media.mit.edu" target="_blank">Pantheon project</a> and the list published in the book Human Accomplishments.</p>
