	<p>Each node represents a language. Links connect languages according to the frequency of book translations. Node size represents the number of native and non-native speakers of a language.</p>

 	<p>The position of a language in the Global Language Network is highly correlated with the number of globally famous people born in the territories associated with that language. We identify globally famous people using The MIT Media Lab’s Pantheon project (pantheon.media.mit.edu) and the list published in the book Human Accomplishments.</p>
