                In the Global Language Network (GLN) each node represents a language and links connect languages that are likely to be co-spoken. In the example above, languages are connected according to the frequency of book translations. Node sizes represent the number of native and non-native speakers of a language and edge thickness represents the number of translations from one language to another.

                In the Global Language Network (GLN) each node represents a language and links connect languages that are likely to be co-spoken. In the example above, two languages are connected when users that tweet in one language are also significantly more likely to tweet in another language. Node size represents the number of native and non-native speakers of a language and edge thickness represents the number of users tweeting in both languages.

            <p>The position of a language in the Global Language Network is highly correlated with the number of globally famous people born in the territories associated with that language. We identify globally famous people using The MIT Media Labâ€™s <a href="http://pantheon.media.mit.edu" target="_blank">Pantheon project</a> and the list published in the book Human Accomplishments.</p>
